MapCurl
=======

An example of how to fake the iOS Map curl to reveal options.

I wanted to implement the curling corner to reveal options animation on my own map. This skeumorphic behavior is what users expect in a map, so it is nice to avoid having a bar button item by providing the familiar curl-up effect. In Maps it seems to be an image, but the second you touch it changes to an interactive animation with paper-like behavior. This was certainly a lot of work for someone to imitate paper. Unfortunately this isn't something that Apple allows 3rd party developers to do out of the box. Here is one solution using a PNG for the corner. Updated for iPhone 5.
